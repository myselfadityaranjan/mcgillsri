  WHAT_WE_DO:
    "The Student Research Initiative is a group of undergraduate students at McGill working to raise funds to create more research opportunities for fellow students. We also strive to assist students by providing information on how to get involved in and conduct research themselves. By organizing exciting networking opportunities and fundraising events, we hope to better inform students about the various research opportunities available, establish connections between researchers and undergraduate students, and participate directly in expanding the number of research opportunities available for students.",

  FSSN_2023: `Exceeding Expectations

1 on 1 interview: Attendees will conduct 5-minute interviews with professors of their choice. If interested, professors may ask you to join their lab during the interview or arrange for another interview!

• Entrance fee ($4 for members and $7 for non-members) * free for virtual events during the pandemic.
